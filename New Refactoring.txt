Just a quick document to explain the new refactoring.
//sorry about the whole notepad thing - haven't gotten around to installing MSWord yet.

Right so, AppMain starts the loop, starts TheGame.
TheGame initialises the window and all that, then starts the ObjectManager and the MechanicManager and updates them.
The ObjectManager starts the EnemyManager, Player and everything else in there and updates them.
EnemyManager handles the spawning of the enemies and runs the Enemy class which has all of the AI in it.  
Player class handles the Weapons, which handles the bullets, and the InputManager, which should eventually handle all input and give instructions to the player.
The MechanicManager handles the game mechanics like TextureSwitching and stuff like that.
The CollisionManager is run by the ObjectManager and takes player and enemy locations as parameters, then tells them what to do.

Please keep it tidy and try to follow this stuff.  If you have any problems using it or want me to get rid of or add a few things then please do tell.

Love ya'<3
